### **Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.**

**Answer:**
**Algorithmic bias** refers to systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create unfair outcomes, such as privileging one group over others. These biases often stem from biased training data, flawed model design, or societal inequalities reflected in data.

**Example 1 ‚Äì Hiring Tools:**
An AI recruiting system trained on historical company data may learn to favor male candidates over females if the past data reflects gender biases in hiring. For example, Amazon‚Äôs AI recruiting tool reportedly downgraded CVs that included the word ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs‚Äù (as in ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs chess club captain‚Äù).

**Example 2 ‚Äì Predictive Policing:**
Predictive policing systems that use crime data may disproportionately target neighborhoods with historically high arrest rates, often populated by minorities, even if those arrest patterns were a result of over-policing rather than actual crime rates. This perpetuates systemic discrimination.

### **Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?**

**Answer:**

* **Transparency** refers to how open and accessible information about the AI system is ‚Äî including how it was trained, the data used, model structure, and decision-making process.
* **Explainability** is about how well a human can understand the model‚Äôs decisions or predictions ‚Äî how and why the AI made a particular choice.

**Why both are important:**

* **Transparency** helps build trust, ensures accountability, and supports regulatory compliance.
* **Explainability** allows users and stakeholders to interpret results, identify biases or errors, and challenge unfair decisions.

Together, they are essential for building **responsible, trustworthy AI systems** that people can safely use and oversee.

### **Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?**

**Answer:**
The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is a legal framework in the European Union that governs the use and protection of personal data. It significantly impacts AI development in the following ways:

1. **Data Minimization:** AI systems must only collect and process data that is necessary and relevant for the intended purpose.
2. **Right to Explanation:** Individuals have the right to understand and challenge automated decisions that affect them ‚Äî enforcing transparency and explainability in AI.
3. **Consent and Fair Processing:** AI developers must obtain informed consent to collect personal data and ensure the data is used lawfully and fairly.
4. **Profiling Restrictions:** GDPR places limits on automated profiling, especially if it produces legal or similarly significant effects on individuals.

Overall, GDPR enforces **ethical boundaries** and **user rights**, encouraging the design of AI systems that are fair, transparent, and privacy-conscious.

### **Q4: Ethical Principles Matching**

**Match the following principles to their definitions:**

| Principle          | Definition                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A) Justice         | ‚úîÔ∏è Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.                  |
| B) Non-maleficence | ‚úîÔ∏è Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.            |
| C) Autonomy        | ‚úîÔ∏è Respecting users‚Äô right to control their data and decisions. |
| D) Sustainability  | ‚úîÔ∏è Designing AI to be environmentally friendly.                 |
